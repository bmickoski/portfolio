> Some details are generalized to respect confidentiality.

## Context
Multiple applications needed shared UI building blocks. Over time, duplication and inconsistent patterns slowed development and made upgrades risky.

## The problem
We needed a scalable way to share UI components across multiple apps without:
- duplicated components and fixes that don’t propagate
- inconsistent UX patterns across products
- surprise breakages during upgrades
- slow onboarding and “tribal knowledge” dependency

## Decision & tradeoffs

<DecisionRecord
  problem="Share UI components across multiple applications with predictable upgrades and self-serve documentation."
  constraints={[
    "Multiple apps consuming the same UI components",
    "Frequent changes required predictable release discipline",
    "Onboarding needed to be fast and self-serve",
  ]}
  options={[
    { title: "Copy/paste components per app", summary: "Fast initially, but duplication grows and UX diverges quickly." },
    { title: "Shared repo without release discipline", summary: "Shared code, but upgrades become unpredictable and risky." },
    { title: "Monorepo packages + versioning + Storybook", summary: "Reusable libraries with controlled releases and living docs." },
  ]}
  decision="Create shared UI libraries as versioned packages in a monorepo, and use Storybook as the public interface for usage patterns and examples."
  rationale={[
    "Versioned packages make upgrades intentional instead of accidental",
    "Storybook becomes the ‘product surface’ for shared UI (docs + examples)",
    "Reusable primitives reduce duplicated effort and inconsistency",
  ]}
/>

## Implementation highlights
- Shared UI packages with clear ownership and a predictable release flow
- Versioning/publishing that reduces “surprise breaks” for consumers
- Storybook stories used as documentation and examples for teams

    { label: "Faster delivery through reuse", detail: "Teams built features by composing shared primitives." },
    { label: "More consistent UX", detail: "Common components reduced divergence across apps." },

## What I’d do next
- Add visual regression tests per Storybook story
- Establish a breaking-change policy + migration guide template per release
- Add “golden path” starter templates for new app teams
